Modular Power Source Management 

Researcher: Wilson Dhalwani <br />
Advisor: Mr. Michael Liva (BCA) <br />
Context: General Research with Specialization in Electrical Engineering <br />
Projekt Name: Modular Power Source Management System <br />
Start Date: Septemeber 30, 2022 <br />

The following repository is for documenting and sharing my work in this research projekt and its related fields of engineering. This was also made for recording my process in solving the issue at hand so that others can learn and build upon my work. This projekt has no end date as innovation never ends, rather, continues until the idea is forgotten, and my hope is that this work can be the basis for future engineers who, too, find great excitement in innovation and design. <br />
