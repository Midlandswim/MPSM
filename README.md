# MPSM Research
Modular Power Source Management 

Researcher: Wilson Dhalwani <br />
Advisor: Mr. Michael Liva (BCA) <br />
Context: General Research with Specialization in Electrical Engineering <br />
Projekt Name: Modular Power Source Management System <br />
Start Date: September 30, 2022 <br />

The following repository is for documenting and sharing my work in this research project and its related fields of engineering. This was also made for recording my process of solving the issue at hand so that others can learn and build upon my work. The MPSM system was created to help address the issue of one of the basics of engineering research and design: power. Almost all of the research projects coming out of our engineering labs at BCA require some degree of power source management, namely with rechargeable lipo batteries, and with the new way of clean, renewable energy, it is a coming must. The MPSM was made to solve that issue, with its modular aspect and customizable ability allowing for quick and effective implementation into most projects. The hope and goal is that others can implement this into their projects, saving time and effort, as well as having the confidence in a powerful system to boot up some of their greatest creations. The greatest innovations are not the ones that allow a man to jump but to confidently step up. This project has no end date as innovation never ends, rather, continues until the idea is forgotten, and my hope is that this work can be the basis for future engineers who, too, find great excitement in innovation and design. <br />
